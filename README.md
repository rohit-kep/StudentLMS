# Studen LMS
This project is a clone to the LMS I study on.

My purpose of doing this project is to...
1. try out new stuff like bun, materialUI, python. (at least I am new to them).
2. learn about video streaming on web and how to handle them.
3. learn how the build a scalable backend that can handle multiple users at the same time.
4. make a project that has above 90% code coverage.


## Features (I'll keep adding them along with code.)
1. basic dashboard that shows student statistics like courses, batch, name, registeration no, attendance etc.
